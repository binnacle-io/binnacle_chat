### Getting Started

The Binncale Chat Widget for Rails is a simple plugin that provides a Rails View Helper
which gives you an floating chat window powered by Binnacle.

#### Installation

Add the binnacle gem to your Gemfile.  In Gemfile:

```
gem 'binnacle_chat'
```

#### Configuration

The Binnacle Chat Widget depends on the following environment variables for configuration. If
you are using the binnacle ruby client in your application, you probably already have most
of them:

```
# The Binnacle Endpoint IP or hostname
BINNACLE_ENDPOINT=localhost

# channel to use
BINNACLE_CHANNEL=k8aobbwziau4x9ks7mh8

# api_key: An approved publisher API key for the App
BINNACLE_API_KEY=cwjlwr0g6w1wvb8f0i04

# api_secret: The API secret for the given API key
BINNACLE_API_SECRET=9nfmvanf409dbcnqx60m
```

#### Usage

Finally, to add the widget to one of your application view. You simply use an ERB
snippet like:

```
<h1>Binnacle Chat Example</h1>

<%= chat(identity: current_user.email) %>
```

In the example above the chat widget will "log in" using as the identity the email
of the current_user object (In this case Devise' current_user object)

### Running the built in example

Create a test app on binnacle.io and add the chat widget. Use the values provided
to complete the .env file as described below.

Make a copy of `./test/dummy/.env_sample` as `./test/dummy/.env` and enter the
appropriate values, also start you local binnacle-engine if you have one then:

```
bundle
cd ./test/dummy
rake db:migrate
foreman start
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and create an account and you should then be
redirected to the sample chat page. Do the same on another browser and now you
can have a conversation with yourself.
