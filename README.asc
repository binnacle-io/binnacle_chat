### Getting Started

The Binncale Chat Widget for Rails is a simple plugin that provides a Rails View Helper
which gives you an floating chat window powered by Binnacle.

#### Installation

Add the binnacle gem to your Gemfile.  In Gemfile:

```
gem 'binnacle_chat'
```

#### Configuration

The Binnacle Chat Widget depends on the following environment variables for configuration. If
you are using the binnacle ruby client in your application, you probably already have most
of them:

```
# endpoint_url: The Binnacle Endpoint URL (BINNACLE_URL)
BINNACLE_URL=http://host:port

# account_id: Your Binnacle Account ID (BINNACLE_ACCOUNT)
BINNACLE_ACCOUNT=fmzdj5490u4kngudt1wy

# app_id: Your Binnacle App ID (BINNACLE_APP)
BINNACLE_APP=4quzpk76eeicvv8b1gmd

# api_key: An approved publisher API key for the App (BINNACLE_API_KEY)
BINNACLE_API_KEY=6yayvgogazuc9xvbjhwh

# api_secret: The API secret for the given API key (BINNACLE_API_SECRET)
BINNACLE_API_SECRET=4z8dnx1jmg1di5jj0poi

# default context to use
BINNACLE_CHAT_CTX=1bkrnlpqvwja1wz3nta3
```

#### Usage

Finally, to add the widget to one of your application view. You simply use an ERB
snippet like:

```
<h1>Binnacle Chat Example</h1>

<%= chat(identity: current_user.email) %>
```

In the example above the chat widget will "log in" using as the identity the email
of the current_user object (In this case Devise' current_user object)

### Running the example

Make a copy of `./test/dummy/.env_sample` as `./test/dummy/.env` and enter the
appropriate values, also start you local binnacle-engine if you have one then:

```
cd ./test/dummy
rake db:migrate
rails server
```

Create an account and you should then be redirected to the sample chat page. Do
the same on another browser and now you can have a conversation with yourself.


### TODOs

- Allow inclusion as non-floating panel
- Add several difference custom partials for bootstrap, foundation, jquery-ui and plain HTML
- Add the ability to select the partial's framework based on a config value
- Hide config information from page (gon gem?)
- Add ability to see room members as part of the widget
- Add ability to see room members in a standalone view helper
- Add the ability to be "invisible"
- Add the ability to save the conversation in a local Rails model
- Add the ability to encrypt/decrypt the conversations
- Add the ability to use local storage on the browser for caching conversations
